- **Summary:** 
   Predict proficiency rates for standardized school testing, along with other questions. Predict future proficiency for ESL students. Predict increase or decrease in proficiency for those who are already proficient.

- **Data Overview**
  The data is a compilation of 3rd-10th grades. It would be beneficial to test follow one grade level across the years, (i.e. follow the 3rd grade to the 4th to the 5th, etc.), it would also be beneficial to conduct regression using all the data to determine if there is some kind of indicator of proficiency.
  
  It seems as though there is no way to determine what the score must be for a student to be considered proficient. It would be beneficial to begin with determining a standard of what is proficiency so that the school can have a way to assess this.
